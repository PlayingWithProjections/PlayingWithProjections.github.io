Basic The basic challenges should be done in order.
 Count the number of events Count the number of registered players Count the number of players registered per month Find the most popular quizzes Look for inactive players  Advanced Not all the advanced challenges have to be done in order.</description>

      <description> This answer depends on Look for bots and Who won this game
The high score is the maximum score a quiz over all played games of that quiz. But, only the score of the first time a player played this quiz counts towards the high score. So when a player gets a higher score on a second play, this score doesn&amp;rsquo;t count.

      <description>The winner of a game is the player with the most points in total for the game. Points are scored per question. To calculate points for a question, calculate 1000 * ( 1 - ( [response time] / 240 )) and round this number down.
In case that multiple players have the same amount of points, there are multiple winners.
Bonus Ofcourse, we want to remove the bots from the winners.</description>

      <description>We have the feeling that we might have cheaters in our system. So we would like you to find the cheaters. First it might be a good idea to think about how we might detect bots/cheaters (what would an incentive be for a cheater?).
When you have some ideas, try to write a projection to detect the bots.

      <description> An inactive player is a player that has either played less than 1 game in 1 month, or has created less than 1 quiz in 1 month for a given month.
Tip If you feel like you know how to do the basic projections, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to skip this challenge and go on to the advanced challenges.
