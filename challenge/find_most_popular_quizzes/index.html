But if you can&rsquo;t find it, or want to check your answer read on.</p>
<p>Ok, so to answer this challenge, we need to be able answer some things:</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-played-quiz">What is a played quiz?</h4>
<p>According to the <a href="/doc/domain">domain</a>, a quiz results in a <code>Game Was Opened</code> and that results in either <code>Game Was Started</code> or <code>Game Was Finished</code>.
So a played quiz means we have to look at either <code>Game Was Started</code> or <code>Game Was Finished</code>.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-find-the-quiz-name">How do we find the quiz name?</h4>
<p>To do this, we need to create a lookup from <code>gameId</code> to <code>quizId</code> to <code>quizTitle</code>. The domain query is: &ldquo;what is the title for this game?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To create the lookup we can follow this chain.  A <code>Game Was Started</code> has a <code>gameId</code>, <code>Game Was Opened</code> has a <code>gameId</code> and a <code>quizId</code> and <code>Quiz Was Created</code> has a <code>quizId</code> and <code>quizTitle</code>.</p>
<p>As was stated earlier, the events are ordered, so if you have a gameId, you know that the quiz was already published.</p>
