<p><em>This is an open question without a fixed answer.</em></p>

<p>We are thinking about starting a targetted marketing campaign to our users.
The problem is that we don&rsquo;t actually know what kind of players we have.
Can you think of what kind of different players we could have? Can you find different clusters of players?</p>
