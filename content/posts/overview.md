You can find all the information necessary to complete the workshop *Playing with projections* here.

## Before you start

### 1. Generating data

Read [this](/doc/generating_data) post and come back here when you are done.

### 2. Picking a technology

Please pick your preferred technology, and follow the readme for that repo.

- [C# (dotnetcore)](/csharp)
- [Java](/java)
- [Javascript](/js)
- [Reason](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/reason)

## You have picked a technology and it is running

If the client runs with the generated data, you're all set. 
Verify that you have a directory structure like this:

```
playing_with_projections/
|--- data/
|    |--- example.json
|    |--- stream.json
|--- [preferred technology]/
|    |--- ...
```

Now you can go on to explore [the domain](/doc/domain) and read about the [api](/doc/api).
