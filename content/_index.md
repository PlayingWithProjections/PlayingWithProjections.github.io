You can find all the information necessary to complete the workshop *Playing with projections* here.

In the top bar you can always find a direct link to this page and other useful pages.

## Before you start

### 1. Create a work directory

Create a new directory. You can call it anything you want, but we suggest naming it `playing_with_projections`. 

### 2. Getting the data

Read [this page](/doc/generating_data) and come back here when you are done.

### 3. Picking a technology

Pick your preferred technology. We **strongly urge** you to pick the language that you know best.
Although you can use this workshop for learning a new language, it's not the goal of the workshop.

Clone that repository in the directory you created in step 1, and follow the readme for that repo. 

- [C# (dotnetcore)](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/csharp)
- [Java](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/java)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/javascript)
- [F# (dotnetcore)](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/fsharp)
- [ReasonML - native](https://github.com/PlayingWithProjections/reason)

### Unsupported/untested

These repositories probably work as well, but they are less tested.

- [PHP](https://github.com/mathiasverraes/playingwithprojections-php)
- [Haskell](https://github.com/mathiasverraes/playingwithprojections-haskell)

## You have picked a technology and it is running

If the client runs with the generated data, you're all set. 

```
playing_with_projections/
|--- data/
|    |--- basic.json
|    |--- full.json
|--- [preferred technology]/
|    |--- ...
```

Now you can go on to explore [the domain](/doc/domain) and read about the [api](/doc/api).

Once you are done with this you can start with [the challenges](/challenge/list).
