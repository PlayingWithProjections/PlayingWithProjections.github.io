*This is an open question without a fixed answer.*

We are thinking about starting a targetted marketing campaign to our users.
The problem is that we don't actually know what kind of players we have.
Can you think of what kind of different players we could have? Can you find different clusters of players?

## Answer

This is an open question without a real answer, come to us and show us what you got. We can always discuss the clustering criteria you thought about.
