The most popular quiz is the quiz that has most played games.
We are looking for the top 10 of the most popular quizzes per month and in total. The answer must contain the name and the id of the quiz.

So we want 2 answers:

- 10 most popular quizzes per month
- 10 most popular in total

### Tip

You can do this challenge as 2 projections, one projection for the answer per month, and one projection for the total. Or you can build it as one projection.
