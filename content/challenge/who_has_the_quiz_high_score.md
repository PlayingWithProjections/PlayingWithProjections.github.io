This answer depends on [Look for bots](/challenge/look_for_bots) and [Who won this game](/challenge/who_won_the_game)

The high score of a quiz is equal to the maximum score a player got on that quiz over all played games. Remember that the maximum score is only counted for players who play the quiz for the first time. So when a player gets a higher score on a second play, this score doesn't count.
