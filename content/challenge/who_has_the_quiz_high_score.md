This answer depends on [Look for bots](/challenge/look_for_bots) and [Who won this game](/challenge/who_won_the_game)

The high score is the maximum score a quiz over all played games of that quiz. But, only the score of the first time a player played
this quiz counts towards the high score. So when a player gets a higher score on a second play, this score doesn't count.
