We recommend you to start with the basic challenges and do them ordered. Once you feel comfortable doing those you can pick one of the advanced challenges.

## Basic

The basic challenges should be done in order. 

1. [Count the number of events](/challenge/count_number_of_events)
1. [Count the number of registered players](/challenge/count_number_of_registered_players)
1. [Count the number of players registered per month](/challenge/count_number_of_registered_players_per_month)
1. [Find the most popular quizzes](/challenge/find_most_popular_quizzes)
1. [Look for inactive players](/challenge/find_inactive_players)

## Advanced

Not all the advanced challenges have to be done in order. It might be a better idea to read all the challenges and pick the one you like most.

1. [Verify marketing campaign](/challenge/verify_marketing_campaign)
1. [Look for bots](/challenge/look_for_bots)
1. [Who won this game](/challenge/who_won_the_game)
1. [Who has the quiz high score](/challenge/who_has_the_quiz_high_score) (depends on look for bots and who won this game)
