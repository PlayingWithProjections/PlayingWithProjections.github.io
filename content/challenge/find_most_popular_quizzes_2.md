Now that we know the overal most popular quizzes, we would also like to know the most popular quizzes per month.
Can you provide us with a top 10 of the most popular quizzes per month. Again, we want the name and id of the quiz.

Can you reuse structures of your previous solution or do you create a new
solution from scratch?
