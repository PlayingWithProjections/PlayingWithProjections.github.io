title: "Find the most popular quizzes (part 3)"
draft: false

In the 2 previous parts, you answered what the most popular quiz is by finding
out how many times the quiz was played. While this is interesting, we're not sure if this is the best way to evaluate popular quizzes. An other metric could be to count how many players joined a game.

Now we ask you to find the most popular quizzes, not by how many times they have been played, but
by how many players joined. The most popular quiz in a given timespan is the quiz where most players joined in that timespan.

We want the same answers as in the previous 2 parts, what is the overal most
popular quiz and what are the most popular per month.

Can you give us insights if these quizzes are the same as the other metrics for popular quiz? What do you find the best metric? Can you think of any other metrics?
